# Brief on BWT Project
This project contains a basic HTML structure of the ISYS3004 Unit outline


## What's next?

The project is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Use these four files as your starting point:

- **README.md:** This is the file that you are reading now contains the appropriate files identifying errors and cross-reference.
- **index.html:** This is the default page for the ISYS3004 project space, where I have written HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **styles.css:** Used the CSS file to style my content and change the look of my space with beautiful colors, fonts and much more. 
- **scripts.js:** Used this file to make my website dynamic and interactive with JavaScript. 

> **Note:** The **styles.css** and **scripts.js** files link into the **index.html** file so that they are all connected.
